Smart Soil Moisture Monitor
An environmental monitoring system featuring a 3-level status display (Wet, Optimal, Dry) using separate LEDs (D2-D4) and an audible alarm (D5) for critical dryness. The design incorporates advanced power management by using Digital Pin D8 to cycle power to the sensor, minimizing corrosion and improving longevity.

2. Traffic Light with Pedestrian Button
A 5-light Infrastructure IoT project coordinating traffic (D0-D2) and pedestrian signals (D3-D4). The system executes a safety-focused, time-based sequence with blinking transitions, fully controlled by a single pedestrian request push-button input (D5).
